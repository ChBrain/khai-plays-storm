# CLAUDE.md, the Storm house

This repository is a **khai plays house**: a production house dedicated to one
source, Theodor Storm. It was raised by khai-stage (the impresario's
generator); the plays are written separately, in khai-playwright mode.

## What lives here

- `plays/` holds the productions: each play file plus the plots it chains and the
  elements those plots cast. This is the only content.
- The rest is the wiring and the gates, raised once and not improvised.

## The house is the Estate

`README.md` is this house's **Estate identity**: the production that answers for
the run. Every play logs the house in its `Estate` (E), and the conformance test
checks the link resolves. A play with no Estate is not yet a production.

## Branching

Computed, not chosen. Let the guard pick the lane:

```
npx khai-guard branch <topic>
```

- `play/<topic>` owns `plays/**` (the productions).
- `governance/<topic>` owns the gates and config (`.github/**`, `.husky/**`,
  `khai-guard.config.json`, `tests/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `REFERENCE.md`, `REFERENCES.md`, `management/**`).
- `changeset-release/*` is a bot-controlled general lane for version releases.

A **management order** (`management/orders/**`) is a **rider**: an order directs
work in any lane, so it rides the lane of the change it drives. Write the order
beside that change and the guard folds both onto one branch (an order that
restages a play lands as one `play/` PR); committed alone, an order homes to
`governance/`. So an order and the change it commands are one PR, never two.

Never `--no-verify`. Never merge; open the PR and stop.

## Versioning

The minor version IS the play count, computed not chosen; the **Version Packages**
PR is the deploy gate every release passes through. `npx khai-tests registry
build` (run by the `version` script) sets the version from the play count:
`0.<count>.0` (the minor is the count, the patch resets to 0), reconciling both
`package.json` and `registry.json`. The build is the single writer of the version
number; never hand-edit it. A fresh, empty house stays `0.0.x`.

- **Adding a play** -> a `minor` changeset. The play PR carries it, so the deploy
  is steered through the Version Packages PR and the CHANGELOG names the play.
  `changeset version` bumps the minor and the build reconciles it back to the play
  count, resetting the patch to 0 (`0.<count>.0`). It **must** be `minor`: a
  `patch` (or empty) changeset survives the reconcile (count === minor) and drifts
  the version to `0.<count>.1`, so the `changeset-check` gate rejects it.
- **A fix to existing content** (ships package `files`) -> a `patch` changeset; it
  ships at the same play count (`0.<count>.1`).
- **A change that ships nothing** (governance, tooling, docs, tests) -> an
  **empty** changeset (`npx changeset add --empty`); it records the PR and merges
  green without republishing identical content.
